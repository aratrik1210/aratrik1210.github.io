#Printing F-pattern using nested loop.

numbers = [5, 2, 5, 2, 2]
for x_count in numbers:
    output = ''
    for count in range(x_count)
         output += 'x'
    print(output)
Output:
xxxxx
xx
xxxxx
xx
xx

Explanation: 
Outer Loop: Goes through each number in the list [5, 2, 5, 2, 2].
Inner Loop: For each number, adds that many 'x' characters to a string.
Print: After the inner loop, prints the number of 'x' characters in the ouput variable.
