# Find duplicate numbers from the list:

numbers = [2, 2, 4, 6, 3, 4, 6, 1]
uniques = []     (created to store unique numbers found in the numbers list)
for number in numbers:
    if number not in uniques:                (For each number in numbers, it checks if the number is not already present in the uniques list.
                                                   If the number is not in uniques, it adds the number to uniques.
    uniques.append(number)
    print(uniques)
