The .lower() and .upper() methods in Python are known as string methods. These methods are built-in functions that operate on string objects, allowing you to perform specific operations on the string data.

course = 'Python for Beginners'
print(course.find('B'))
Output = 11 (index of B is 11)

course = 'Python for Beginners'
print(course.replace('Beginners','Students'))
Output = Python for Students

course = 'Python for Beginners'
print('For'in course)
Output = False (Boolean expression, returns False as For is absent in course, for is present)
