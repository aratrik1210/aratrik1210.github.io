course = 'Python for Beginners'
print(course[0:4][-3:-1])
Output: yt 
Reason: course[0:4] = Pyth
        Pyth[-3:-1] = yt (doesn't include -1th letter i.e. h)



Eg: course = 'Python for Beginners'
print(course[0:3])
Output: Pyt

print(course[0:]) = Python for Beginners (end index not provided so entire string gets printed)

course = 'Python for Beginners'
print(course[:3]) = Pyt (If start index not given; 0 is assumed

course = 'Python for Beginners'
print(course[:]) = Python for Beginners (No start or end index provided; start is assumed 0 and entire original string returns as output)

name = 'Jennifer'
print(name[1:-1])
Output = ennife
