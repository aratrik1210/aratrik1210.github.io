x = 10
x += 3   (+= is an augmented arithmetic operator; + and = are enhanced together)
print(x)
Output = 13

[Applicable for -=, *=, /= etc.]

Order of Precedence:
Parenthesis
Exponentiation
Multiplication or Division
Addition or Subtraction

X = 10 + 3*2**2
print(x)
output = 22 [10 + 3(4)]

x = (2+3)* 10-3
print(x)
output = 47[5*10 - 3]

MATH FUNCTIONS -- 

x = 2.9
print(round(x))
output = 3

x = 2.9
print(abs(-x))
output = 2.9 (abs always returns a positive value)

For doing mathematical calculations, you need to install the math module.

Module is like a supermarket section, that has everything needed to do a particular function (here mathematical calculations)

import math

print(math.floor(2.9)) [rounds a number DOWN to the nearest integer]
output = 2

print(math.ceil(2.9)) [returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a given number]
output = 3
