CODE 1:

first = 'John'
last = 'Smith'
message = first + ' [' + last + '] is a coder'  
print(message)

CODE 2:

first = 'John'
last = 'Smith'
msg = f'{first} [{last}] is a coder'
print(msg)

Output: John [Smith] is a coder (Same for both)

EXPLANATION: In CODE 1; the + operator is used to concatenate multiple strings together. This can be less readable, especially with more variables and complex strings.
             In CODE 2; An f-string (formatted string) is used, denoted by the prefix f before the string. more readable and concise, especially for complex strings or multiple variables.
