phone: 1234

customer = {
    "name": "John Smith",
    "age": 30,
    "is_verified": True
}
print(customer["name"])

print(customer["Name"]) or print(customer["Birthdate"]) - Key error will return as these keys do not exist.

# we can also update the keys or values:

customer["name"] = "Jack Smith"
customer["birthdate"] = " 12th Oct 2001"
print(customer["birthdate"])
Output:
12th Oct 2001
