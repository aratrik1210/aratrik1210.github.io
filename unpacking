#unpacking

coordinates = (1, 2, 3)
x = coordinates[0]
y = coordinates[1]
z = coordinates[2]
print(x, y, z)

output:
1, 2, 3

However, the same output can be obtained writing much less code - process called unpacking

coordinates = (1, 2, 3)
x, y, z = coordinates
print(x, y, z)

Output:
1, 2, 3

This works for lists as well:

coordinates = [1, 2, 3]
print(x, y, z)

Output:
1, 2, 3
